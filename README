appengine -> http -> go-get-proxy (this) -> {git,hg,svn,bzr} -> internet

# Stackato notes

## Known limitations

after deployment, ssh into the app and run:

  git clone ssh://gitolite@gitolite.activestate.com/tail /tmp/x

then hit "yes" to the ssh host key verification (the app doesn't
handle this gracefully).
